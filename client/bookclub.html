            Welcome to The Book Club. Here we will be keeping track of the books we have read. We can enter the information of books we want to read, books we are currently reading, and any past books we have read. This will keep track of their titles, authors, publishers, the year published, genre, and ISBN. This will help to keep track of our favorite genres, authors, and the books we have read.
